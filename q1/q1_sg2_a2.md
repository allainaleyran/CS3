### Instructions:
The problem: Finding the highest (Maximum) number from a given list of numbers.


| PseudoCode 1 | PseudoCode 2 |
| --- | --- |
| Algorithm FindMax1(numbers)
 max ← numbers[0]
 For i from 1 to length(numbers)-1
  If numbers[i] > max Then
   max ← numbers[i]
  EndIf
 EndFor
 Return max
EndAlgorithm | Algorithm FindMax2(numbers)
 For i from 0 to length(numbers)-1bigger ← true
  For j from 0 to length(numbers)-1
   If numbers[j] > numbers[i] Then
    bigger ← false
   EndIf
  EndFor
  If bigger = true Then
   Return numbers[i]
  EndIf
 EndFor
EndAlgorithm |
